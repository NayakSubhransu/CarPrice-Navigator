## Overview

- The project's goal is to create a reliable and easy-to-use tool for predicting car prices that will assist buyers and sellers in the tough auto industry.
- The accuracy and transparency of the model predictions may be ensured by identifying the main elements influencing automotive costs through a thorough dataset analysis. 


## Key Features

- Data Cleaning And EDA 
- Implements The Linear Regression Algorithm 
- Implements Model Pipelining 
- Car Prediction Website Created using Flask
    
## Dataset

The system utilizes a used car dataset containing cars and their details. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features, which are then used to train and evaluate the recommendation system.

## Requirements
- click
- Flask
- Flask-Cors
- gunicorn
- itsdangerous
- Jinja2
- joblib
- MarkupSafe
- numpy
- pandas
- pickle-mixin
- python-dateutil
- pytz
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- six
- sklearn
- threadpoolctl
- Werkzeug

  
## Usage

- Car prediction models help with figuring out the best price, predicting sales and demand, doing preventative maintenance, and evaluating risk.
- In general, they make production, sales, upkeep, and customer happiness much better in the car industry.

## Future Improvements

- Use deep learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
- Improve the user interface to provide a more user-friendly experience.
- Include more data sources to increase prediction accuracy
