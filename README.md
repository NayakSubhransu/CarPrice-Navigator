## `About` 
<p align="justify">

- The project's goal is to create a reliable and easy-to-use tool for predicting car prices that will assist buyers and sellers in the tough auto industry.
- The accuracy and transparency of the model predictions may be ensured by identifying the main elements influencing automotive costs through a thorough dataset analysis. 

See the implementation details with <a href="https://github.com/NayakSubhransu/Car_Price_Prediction/blob/main/Car%20Prediction.ipynb">IPython Notebook</a>
</p>

python app_cli.py
```

## `Key Features`

- Data Cleaning And EDA 
- Implements The Linear Regression Algorithm 
- Implements Model Pipelining 
- Car Prediction Website Created using Flask

## `Getting Started`

This Project is Built With <br /><br />
[![Anaconda][anaconda-shield]][anaconda-url] [![VSCode][vscode-shield]][vscode-url]

## `Dataset`

The system utilizes a used car dataset containing cars and their details. The dataset is preprocessed to extract relevant features, which are then used to train and evaluate the recommendation system.

## `Requirements`
- click
- Flask
- Flask-Cors
- gunicorn
- itsdangerous
- Jinja2
- joblib
- MarkupSafe
- numpy
- pandas
- pickle-mixin
- python-dateutil
- pytz
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- six
- sklearn
- threadpoolctl
- Werkzeug

  
## `Usage`

- Car prediction models help with figuring out the best price, predicting sales and demand, doing preventative maintenance, and evaluating risk.
- In general, they make production, sales, upkeep, and customer happiness much better in the car industry.

## `Future Improvements`

- Use deep learning models to improve prediction accuracy.
- Improve the user interface to provide a more user-friendly experience.
- Include more data sources to increase prediction accuracy

## `Contributing`

Contributions to the car_price_prediction are welcome. If you find any issues or would like to add new features, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
