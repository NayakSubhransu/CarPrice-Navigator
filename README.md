### 2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to maintain a clean and isolated setup for the project dependencies.

   - For Anaconda:

     ```sh
     conda create -n env_name python=3.10
     conda activate env_name
     ```

   - For venv:
     - Windows:
       ```sh
       py -3 -m venv myvenv
       myvenv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - macOS/Linux:
       ```sh
       python3 -m venv myvenv
       source myvenv/bin/activate
       ```
### 3. Install the required packages:
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 4. Run the Flask app:
     `python app.py`
Open the generated URL in a web browser to use the app.

### 5. For CLI predictions, run:
     `python app_cli.py`
